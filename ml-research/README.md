### Collaborative Filtering:

User-User Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on similar users' preferences.

Item-Item Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the similarity of items that the user has previously rated or interacted with.

Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering: Uses a whole dataset to make predictions.

Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD, Funk SVD, SVD++)

Neural Collaborative Filtering

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

Autoencoders

### Content-Based Filtering:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Used to extract features from content.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between user profiles or item descriptions.

Naive Bayes Classifier: Can be used to recommend items similar to those the user has liked in the past.

### Hybrid Systems:

Hybrid Collaborative and Content-Based Filtering: Combines the strengths of both collaborative and content-based approaches.

Context-Aware Recommendations: Incorporates contextual information such as time, location, and user's current activity.

Knowledge-Based Recommendations: Uses explicit knowledge about items and user preferences.
